<strong>Setting <u>an</u> objective</strong> will enable scarce resources to be organised in a way that best achieves the chosen objective.
Many businesses have more than one objective, but some are conflicting, and decisions must be made in terms of choosing which objective to prioritise.
<li>Objectives will vary from firm to firm, and a single firm may change its objectives over time. Here we consider the dominant objectives that shape the behaviour of firms.</li>

<p><h3>Maximising objectives</h3></p>
<a href>The starting point for an analysis of business objectives is to consider how businesses attempt to maximise an outcome, including maximising profits, the quantity sold, or the revenue gained.</a>

<p>Profit maximisation is often regarded as the key metric<br> by which a firm's performance is evaluated,<br><br> and it is the starting point for an analysis of business objectives.</p>
